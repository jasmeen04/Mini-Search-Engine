# Mini-Search-Engine

This project implements a search engine in C++ using a trie data structure to index and search through documents based on user queries.

# Features

**Trie Data Structure:** Utilizes a trie for efficient storage and retrieval of document IDs associated with words.

**Document Loading**: Reads input documents from a specified file and indexes them into the trie.

**Querying**: Allows users to enter search queries and retrieves documents containing the queried words.

# Requirements

C++ compiler

Standard C++ libraries

# Usage

**Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

**Build the Project**:Compile the project using a C++ compiler.

**Run the Application**:Execute the compiled binary to start the search engine application.

**Interact with the Application**:Follow the prompts to load documents and perform searches based on user queries.

# Code Structure

**search_engine.h:** Header file defining the SearchEngine class interface.

**search_engine.cpp:** Implementation file for the SearchEngine class methods.

**documents.txt:**  Sample input file containing documents to be indexed by the search engine.

**README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
